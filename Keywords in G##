In G##, !! and % are both modulus operators, but they behave slightly differently:

!! is the integer modulus operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the dividend by the divisor, where both dividend and divisor are integers.

% is the floating-point modulus operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the dividend by the divisor, where either dividend or divisor is a floating-point number.

Here's an example:

x = 17 !! 5

x = 2

y = 17 % 5

y = 2.0

In this example, both !! and % return the same result, but the data type of the result is different. The result of !! is an integer, while the result of % is a floating-point number.

In G##, the ** operator is used for exponentiation. It raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

Here's an example:

x = 2 ** 3

x = 8

Vokar(x)

In mathematics 2 ** 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8

In this example, the ** operator raises 2 to the power of 3, resulting in 8.
