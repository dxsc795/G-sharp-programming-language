G## Programming Language

Syntax and Semantics
- Consistent naming conventions: camelCase
- Simplified comments: `?` (single-line), `[* *]` (multi-line)
- Indentation-based code block syntax with clear rules for scope
- The symbol `#` is used to separate the control flow statement from the code block that follows.

In G##, `!!` and `%` are both modulus operators, but they behave slightly differently:

!! is the integer modulus operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the dividend by the divisor, where both dividend and divisor are integers.

% is the floating-point modulus operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the dividend by the divisor, where either dividend or divisor is a floating-point number.

Here's an example:

x = 17 !! 5   

x = 2

y = 17 % 5  

y = 2.0

In this example, both `!!` and `%` return the same result, but the data type of the result is different. The result of `!!` is an integer, while the result of `%` is a floating-point number.


In G##, the `**` operator is used for exponentiation. It raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

Here's an example:

x = 2 ** 3    

x = 8

Vokar(x)

In mathematics
2 ** 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8

In this example, the `**` operator raises 2 to the power of 3, resulting in 8.

Functions
*Function Definitions

Here is the revised section on functions:

Functions

_Function Definitions_

In G##, functions are defined using the `dox` keyword.

```
dox functionName(parameters) #
  // function body
```

_Function Calls_

Functions can be called by their name followed by parentheses containing the arguments.

```
functionName(arguments)
```

_Lambda Functions_

G## also supports lambda functions, which are small anonymous functions.

```
Lamb(parameters) #
  // lambda function body
```

_Nonlocal Functions_

Nonlocal functions are functions that are defined inside another function.

```
outer functionName(parameters) #
  // nonlocal function body
```

_Global Functions_

Global functions are functions that are defined outside of any other function.

```
universal functionName(parameters) #
  // global function body
```

_Function Examples_

Here is an example of a simple function:

```
dox greet(name) #
  vokar("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Emil")
```

This will output: "Hello, Emil!"
Here is the rest of the document:

Classes and Objects

_Class Definitions_

In G##, classes are defined using the `type` keyword.

```
type ClassName #
  // class body
```

_Class Constructors_

Class constructors are special methods that are called when an object is created.

```
lize(parameters) #
  // constructor body
```

_Class Methods_

Class methods are functions that belong to a class.

```
methodName(parameters) #
  // method body
```

_Class Properties_

Class properties are variables that belong to a class.

```
property_name = value
```

_Object Creation_

Objects can be created using the `new` keyword.

```
new ClassName(arguments)
```

_Object Examples_

Here is an example of a simple class:

```
type Person #
  lize(name, age) #
    this.name = name
    this.age = age

  sayHello() #
    vokar("Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.")

person = new Person("Emil", 30)
person.sayHello()
```

This will output: "Hello, my name is Emil and I am 30 years old."

Exceptions

_Try-Catch Blocks_

G## supports try-catch blocks for exception handling.

```
attempt #
  // code that may throw an exception
catch exception #
  // code to handle the exception
ensure #
  // code to always execute, regardless of whether an exception was thrown
```

_Throwing Exceptions_

Exceptions can be thrown using the `throw` keyword.

```
throw exception
```

_Assertions_

Assertions can be used to verify that a condition is true.

```
verify condition
```

_Exception Examples_

Here is an example of a try-catch block:

```
attempt #
  x = 5 / 0
catch exception #
  vokar("An error occurred: " + exception.message)
```

This will output: "An error occurred: Division by zero"

Modules and Packages

_Importing Modules_

Modules can be imported using the `load` keyword.

```
load moduleName
```

_Exporting Modules_

Modules can be exported using the `exload` keyword.

```
exload moduleName
```

_Package Management_

G## supports package management using the `namespace` keyword.

```
namespace packageName #
  // package contents
```

_Module Examples_

Here is an example of importing a module:

```
load math

result = math.add(2, 3)
vokar(result)  // outputs 5
```

Standard Library

The G## standard library provides a wide range of functions and classes for various tasks, including:

- Math functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, etc.
- String functions: `concat`, `split`, `replace`, etc.
- Array functions: `sort`, `reverse`, `push`, `pop`, etc.
- Object functions: `keys`, `values`, `entries`, etc.

Best Practices

Here are some best practices for writing G## code:

- Use meaningful variable names and follow a consistent naming convention.
- Use comments to explain your code and make it easier to understand.
- Use functions to organize your code and make it reusable.
- Use classes to define custom data types and organize your code.
- Use exceptions to handle errors and make your code more robust.

Future Development

The G## language is still in development, and there are many features and improvements planned for the future. Some of the planned features include:

- Support for concurrency and parallel programming.
- Support for functional programming.
- Improved support for object-oriented programming.
- A comprehensive standard library.
- A debugger and other development tools.
